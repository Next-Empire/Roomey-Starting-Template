# Roomey - `( Starting Template )`

This is a basic template for Roomey that we use as a starting point for every new service we create. Whenever we start a new project, we clone this repository and begin coding from there. You are welcome to contribute to this repository and help make it even better. We believe this is a great starting point for building high-quality services with Roomey
